Extra packages to help enhance Kali Linux

Download and run this script to help add additional (and useful) packages to Kali Linux.

The script is a (very) simple shell script. Once downloaded, just chmod +x the script and let it run as root.

**NOTE1: This script comes with no warranties - its simply something made to make life a little easier when deploying a Kali Linux installation._**

**NOTE2:Some of these packages may be already present. Running this script shouldn't make any changes to any of these already installed packages._**

**NOTE3: This script is a bit ugly and 'clunky' so don't complain if you feel its not very well refined... it is what it is... :-)_**
