Extra packages to help enhance Kali Linux

Download and run this script to help add additional (and useful) packages to Kali Linux.

The script is a (very) simple shell script. Once downloaded, just chmod +x the script and let it run as root.

Note1: This script comes with no warranties - its simply something made to make life a little easier when deploying a Kali Linux installation.
Note2: Some of these packages may be already present. Running this script shouldn't make any changes to any of these already installed packages.
